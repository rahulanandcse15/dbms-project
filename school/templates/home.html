        Learning beyond Classroom” is the hallmark of the school educational system. So, to achieve this, educational tours are regularly organised by the school to promote national and international understanding. Tours of national importance are being organised to develop understanding of our cultural heritage camping expeditions, picnics, visit to world heritage sites are also organized.
        Every few hundreds years………… there occurs a sharp transformation. Within decades, society-its worldview, its basic values, its social and political structures, its arts, its key institutions rearranges itself. And the people born then cannot imagine a world in which their grandparents lived and into which their own parents were born. We are currently living through such a transformation.
